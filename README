Generate rounds of tournaments, where nobody plays with the same partner more than once.

Due to random selection, some rounds don't generate a full n/2 pairs, which  means they don't generate a full n/4 matches. 

Use it:

first argument is one person per line
second argument is number of rounds
python tourney.py /path/to/people 5

end of the output is a list of rounds. Each round is pairs of people matched together.
